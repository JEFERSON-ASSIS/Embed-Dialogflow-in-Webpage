# Embed-Dialogflow-in-Webpage
Heres some simple code that shows a chat window as an overlay (similar to facebook ). Chat is hidden by default and visible only on click.


All you have to do is update the `src='EnterIframeLinkToDialogflowChatbot'`(line 4 - dialogflow_chatbot.js)
and include the `dialogflow_chatbot.js` in your webpage!


Thats it! Its done.
