# Embed-Dialogflow-in-Webpage
Heres some simple code that shows a chat window as an overlay (similar to facebook ). Chat is hidden by default and visible only on click.


All you have to do is update the `iframe src link`("EnterIframeLinkToDialogflowChatbot" on line 4)
and include the `dialogflow_chatbot.js` in your webpage!


Thats it! Its done.
